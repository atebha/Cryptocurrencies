# Cryptocurrencies

Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to sift through unclean data for a unsupervised model. The data needed to be processed, cleaned up and clusted. the clusters were dimensioned and eventually run through a PCA. This was all done to know what cryptos were being traded in the market. 

Challenges:

Some of the dependecies would not load due to a hardware issue. This prevented a proper analysis form being done but some of the cleaning for the data could be accomplished. 

Results:
